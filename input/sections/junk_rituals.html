This project started from the discover in a closing down sale of a circular sawblade, a device with a particular sound reminescent of ritual instruments like temple bells and singing bowls, while still retaining some of the industrial clang.
From this the idea of a pseudo-ritual instrument made from the sinergy of the sawblade sound and projected everchanging visuals, a union of the concrete sound of the material and the abstract nature of light and code.<br>
<br>
Realized with a piezo sensor, an Arduino microcontroller, Raspberry Pi, a pico projector and a glockenspiel mallet for playing the sawblade. Coded with Arduino IDE and openFrameworks. <br>
